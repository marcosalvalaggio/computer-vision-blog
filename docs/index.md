# A brief introduction


The purpose of the site/blog/doco (builded with [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)) is to be a container of computer vision theories I studied. 

Every section/post is produced using a markdown file obtained by converting a jupyter notebook. The main frameworks used for the studies are:

* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
