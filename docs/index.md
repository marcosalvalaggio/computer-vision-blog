# A brief introduction

The purpose of the blog is to showcase the computer vision theories I have studied. I aim to publish a new post each month, covering a different topic and providing a detailed explanation.

Every section/post is produced using a markdown file obtained by converting a jupyter notebook. The main frameworks used for the studies are:

* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
